By the end, you\u2019ll know which tool fits your coding style, how it can save you time, reduce mistakes, and make your work feel more fun. According to a recent McKinsey report, about \u00b7 78% of organizations now use AI tools in at least one business function, which includes code-generation and automation.",
      "I hope you\u2019ve now got a much clearer idea of how AI-powered CLI tools like Codebuff, Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Amazon Q, and Codex can fit into your terminal workflow. Each one approaches coding help a little differently, from generating functions to managing AWS tasks, but all of them aim to cut down repetitive work and reduce context switching.",
      "Command-line interfaces have always been a staple for developers because they\u2019re fast, scriptable, and keep you close to your code. Adding AI features to the CLI builds on that strength by automating routine steps such as writing boilerplate code, generating tests, or fixing small bugs. Instead of switching between a browser and your editor, you can describe a task once and run it directly from the terminal.",
      "This approach cuts down on repetitive work and context-switching, freeing up time for the parts of coding that require real design and problem-solving. Whether you\u2019re working on a small personal project or a large codebase, AI-enabled CLI tools help streamline common tasks and keep your workflow focused, and in the next section, we\u2019ll look at five specific tools that show how this works in practice."
