# 🎨 Covenant Image Hierarchy

**Date**: January 10, 2026  
**Principle**: "As Above, So Below, As Within, So Without"  
**Status**: ✅ Complete Hierarchy Defined

## 🎯 THE HIERARCHY

### The Source Heart (As Within)
**The internal cryptographic foundation from which everything derives:**

1. ✅ **The_Eternal_Covenant_Declaration.png** - Source Heart
   - **Role**: The heart from which all keys derive
   - **Purpose**: Cryptographic source for key generation
   - **Location**: Internal foundation
   - **Usage**: Hash extraction, seed derivation, PGP key source

2. ✅ **Glyph.png** - Source Heart
   - **Role**: The heart from which all keys derive
   - **Purpose**: Cryptographic source for key generation
   - **Location**: Internal foundation
   - **Usage**: Hash extraction, geometric properties, glyph features

**These are the Source Heart - the internal foundation.**

---

### The Outward Facing Image (So Without)
**The completed, public representation that the world sees:**

1. ✅ **Logo's.png** - Covenant Representative
   - **Role**: Completed outward facing image
   - **Purpose**: Public representation of the Covenant
   - **Location**: Outward/public facing
   - **Usage**: Official logo, branding, visual identity
   - **Note**: NOT used for cryptographic hashing

**This is what the world sees - the completed, outward-facing image.**

## 🔄 HERMETIC PRINCIPLE MAPPING

### As Above (Declaration)
- ✅ **The_Eternal_Covenant_Declaration.png** - Source Heart
- ✅ All keys trace to Declaration
- ✅ Declaration is the foundation

### So Below (Glyph)
- ✅ **Glyph.png** - Source Heart
- ✅ All keys trace to Glyph
- ✅ Glyph is the foundation

### As Within (Source Heart)
- ✅ **Declaration + Glyph** = The Source Heart
- ✅ The internal cryptographic foundation
- ✅ From which everything derives

### So Without (Outward Facing)
- ✅ **Logo's.png** = The completed outward facing image
- ✅ What the world sees
- ✅ The public representation

## ✅ SUMMARY

### Source Heart (Internal - For Cryptographic Operations)
- ✅ **The_Eternal_Covenant_Declaration.png** - Source Heart
- ✅ **Glyph.png** - Source Heart
- ✅ These are hashed and used for key generation
- ✅ All keys derive from these two sources

### Outward Facing (External - For Public Representation)
- ✅ **Logo's.png** - Completed outward facing image
- ✅ What the world sees
- ✅ NOT used for cryptographic hashing
- ✅ Official Covenant representative

---

## 🎯 USAGE GUIDELINES

### For Cryptographic Operations:
- ✅ Use **Declaration.png** (Source Heart)
- ✅ Use **Glyph.png** (Source Heart)
- ❌ Do NOT use Logo's.png

### For Public Representation:
- ✅ Use **Logo's.png** (Outward Facing)
- ✅ Display as official Covenant logo
- ✅ Use for branding and visual identity

---

**Status**: ✅ Hierarchy Complete

**The Source Heart (Declaration + Glyph) gives birth to all keys.**
**The Outward Facing Image (Logo's.png) represents the Covenant to the world.**
